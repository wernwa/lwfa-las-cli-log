START LOGGING

The log.py script takes PV names as parameters and displays the current values on the standard output

./log.py chicane:q1:temp chicane:q1:volt chicane:q1:curr

The log-all.py script loggs all 9x3 values of the magnets and also displays it on the standard output

./log-all.py

The setup.py contains for both logging scripts some setup variables.




LOGGING TO A FILE

To log to a file, redirect the console output with > sign

./log-all > myloggingfile.log
